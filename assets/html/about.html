                <p>We need your help to raise awareness and develop a network for this deadly but preventable disease. If you or someone you know has been affected by brain stroke, we invite you to share your experience to help others.</p>
                <p>We are forming a WhatsApp group of like-minded people to discuss factors that led to brain hemorrhage in patients and whether timely treatment was beneficial. This information will serve as a guide to those with risk factors (SHAADOWSS) and as a major prevention tool.</p>
